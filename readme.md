# Language Learning through YouTube Subtitles

This repository is dedicated to assisting in language learning through the use of YouTube video subtitles. It downloads subtitles from YouTube videos, identifies the most common words, and presents them for memorization.

## Features

- Downloads YouTube video subtitles.
- Analyzes the subtitles to identify the most frequently used words.
- Presents the common words for memorization.

## How it Works

The project uses Python scripts to download and analyze the subtitles. The main script, `run.py`, coordinates the process. The `src/create_markdowns.py` script generates markdown files for each video, containing the video's title, date, description, tags, and the most common words.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory, and run the `run.py` script.

## Future Plans

This project is still in its early stages. Future plans include improving the word analysis algorithm and adding support for more languages.
